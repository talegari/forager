\title{Compute auxiliary information (proximity, dissimilarity, outlyingness, depth) and imputation from tree ensembles on new data}
\description{
\pkg{unsupervised} package provides unsupervised random forest methods to
compute and \strong{predict} (on new data):

\itemize{

\item Dissimilarity and proximity matrices (useful in clustering observations
and visualizing the dissimilarities)

\item Detect outliers (by outlyingness)

\item Impute missing data }

The package implements various unsupervised random forest methods:

\itemize{

\item \strong{synthetic}:

\itemize{

\item Create synthetic data by sampling each covariate.

\item Classify actual versus synthetic data using a random forest model.

\item Obtain proximity between observations by counting the number of times a
pair of observations occur together in a terminal node of a tree.

}

For details, see Tao shi (2006).

The following outputs might be obtained from this method:

\itemize{

\item \strong{Distance or proximity matrix}: This might be used to
\strong{cluster} the observations using Hierarchical clustering,  PAM
(partitioning around mediods), DBScan and other clustering methods that work
with distance or dissimilarity matrices. Low dimensional embedding methods
like MDS (Multi-dimensional scaling), TSNE allow \strong{visualizing} the
dissimilarities. Quoting from Andy Liaw et al (2002): "The idea is that real
data points that are similar to one another will frequently end up in the
same terminal node of a tree, exactly what is measured by the proximity
matrix".

\item \strong{Variable Importance}: The synthetic data \emph{destroys} the
relationship among the covariates. The random forest classifier tries to
distinguish the classes: actual and synthetic based on the covariates.
\emph{High} OOB Error is an indication of lack of relationship or interaction
among the covariates. When the OOB error is \emph{low} enough, a variable
importance measure would indicate a set of covariates with \emph{high}
interactions among some subsets of themselves.

\item \strong{Outlyingness}: This measure of outlyingness for the jth
observation is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of squared proximities
between that observation and all other observations in the same class (from
Andy Liaw et al (2002))

\item \strong{Impute missing data}: At the first step, the each column is
imputed by its median/mode value and a proximity matrix of the previous step
is used in the further steps to estimate the missing value where the
proximities are used in the weighted average. These iterations are continued
until values do not change beyond a threshold or until some maximum
iterations are reached.

When the imputation is run in 'predict' mode, the random forest model built
during train is utilized to estimate proximities.

The \pkg{randomForest} package also provides proximity matrices by running
unsupervised mode. The \pkg{unsupervised} package differs from the
implementation in \pkg{randomForest} package in these ways:

\itemize{

\item Random forest is computed using 'ranger' package.

\item Provides the \strong{predict} method. This may be used to compute the
pairwise distances between observations of a new dataset, understand
outliers, impute by learning from the training dataset. When predict method
is "terminalNodes", the observations of the new data traverse through the
trees built by the randomforest on training dataset and pairwise distance is
computed by counting the number of times the pair land in the same terminal
node.

\item The \strong{predict} method can be run with any ranger(trained by
\code{\link[ranger]{ranger}}) or randomForest(trained by
\code{\link[randomForest]{randomForest}}) model
